## Features

The dashboard provides the following functionalities:

1.  **Comprehensive Performance Tracking:**
    * Overall KPIs: Total Revenue, Total Payout, Total Orders, Average ROAS, Average Order Value, Active Influencers.
    * Conversion Funnel: Visualizes the journey from "Total Posts" to "Total Orders" to "Total Revenue".
    * Time-Series Analysis: ROAS Trend over time.
    * Platform and Brand Performance: Insights into which platforms and brands generate the most revenue and best ROAS.
    * Influencer Distribution: Scatter plot of Influencer Revenue vs. ROAS.

2.  **Advanced Financial Analytics:**
    * **ROI & ROAS Calculation:** Calculates standard Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).
    * **Incremental ROAS:** Provides an interactive slider to estimate "baseline revenue" (organic sales) for a more accurate incremental ROAS calculation, showing the true uplift from campaigns.

3.  **Granular Filtering:**
    * Filters are located directly in the main dashboard for easy access.
    * Filter by **Date Range** (predefined options like Last 30 Days, All Time).
    * Filter by **Brand** (e.g., MuscleBlaze, HKVitals, Gritzo).
    * Filter by **Platform** (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter).
    * Filter by **Influencer Category** (e.g., Fitness, Nutrition).
    * Filter by **Influencer Tier** (Nano, Micro, Mid, Macro, Mega - based on follower count).

4.  **Actionable Influencer Insights:**
    * **Key Insights Summary:** Dynamic textual summaries of overall performance, top platform, best brand, and count of high-performing influencers (5x+ ROAS).
    * **Top Performing Influencers Table:** Displays a sortable table of top influencers with detailed metrics (Followers, Posts, Orders, Revenue, Spend, ROAS).
    * **CSV Export:** Ability to download the "Top Influencers" summary data.

## Data Model

The dashboard uses four simulated datasets, generated by `simulate_data.py`. These files are expected to be in the project root directory when running the app. They can be in CSV (`.csv`) or Parquet (`.parquet`) format. The dashboard is currently configured to read **Parquet** files for memory efficiency.

1.  **`influencers.parquet`**: Contains influencer metadata.
    * `ID`: Unique identifier.
    * `name`: Influencer's name.
    * `category`: Niche/category (e.g., Fitness, Nutrition).
    * `gender`: Gender.
    * `follower_count`: Number of followers.
    * `platform`: Primary platform.
    * `tier` (calculated): Nano, Micro, Mid, Macro, Mega.

2.  **`posts.parquet`**: Details of each influencer post.
    * `influencer_id`: Links to `influencers.ID`.
    * `platform`: Platform where post was made.
    * `date`: Date of the post.
    * `URL`, `caption`, `reach`, `likes`, `comments`.

3.  **`tracking_data.parquet`**: Records of conversions/orders attributed to influencers.
    * `source`: (e.g., 'Influencer Marketing').
    * `campaign`: Specific campaign name.
    * `influencer_id`: Links to `influencers.ID`.
    * `user_id`: Unique user ID.
    * `product`: Product purchased.
    * `brand` (derived): Brand of the product (e.g., 'MuscleBlaze').
    * `date`: Date of the order.
    * `orders`: Number of orders.
    * `revenue`: Revenue generated.

4.  **`payouts.parquet`**: Records of payments made to influencers.
    * `influencer_id`: Links to `influencers.ID`.
    * `basis`: Payment basis ('post' or 'order').
    * `rate`: Rate per post or per order.
    * `orders`: Attributed orders if `basis` is 'order'.
    * `total_payout`: Total amount paid.


## Key Metrics and Calculations

* **ROI (Return on Investment)**: `((Total Revenue - Total Payout) / Total Payout) * 100` (Calculated for Incremental ROAS, also implied by ROAS).
* **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: `Total Revenue / Total Payout`
* **Incremental ROAS**: `(Total Revenue - Baseline Revenue) / Total Payout`
    * `Baseline Revenue` is an assumed percentage of `Total Revenue` that would have occurred organically.
* **Cost Per Order (CPO)**: `Total Payout / Total Orders` (Can be derived from KPIs).
* **Influencer Tiering:** Categorization based on `follower_count`: Nano (<10k), Micro (10k-100k), Mid (100k-1M), Macro (1M-5M), Mega (5M+).

## Assumptions

* **Data Availability:** Assumes the simulated data files (`.parquet` or `.csv`) are always present in the root directory when the app starts.
* **Currency:** All monetary values are in Indian Rupees (â‚¹).
* **Incremental ROAS Baseline:** The dashboard allows a manual input for the baseline percentage of organic sales. For a more sophisticated analysis, A/B testing or advanced attribution models would be required.
* **Deployment Limitations:** Acknowledges the inherent limitations of `st.dataframe` for complex cell styling and the impracticality of direct PDF export from Streamlit (recommending browser print).

## Setup and Installation (Local)

Follow these steps to set up and run the dashboard on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/healthkart-influencer-dashboard.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/healthkart-influencer-dashboard.git)
    cd healthkart-influencer-dashboard
    ```
    (Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username).

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    * Open your terminal/command prompt inside the `healthkart_dashboard_project` folder.
    * Create the virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    * Activate the virtual environment:
        * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
            ```bash
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        * **On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):**
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        * Your terminal prompt should start with `(venv)`.

3.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    * With the virtual environment active, install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *(This will install Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, NumPy, Faker, PyArrow).*

4.  **Generate Simulated Data Files:**
    * Run the simulation script to create the `.parquet` data files:
        ```bash
        python simulate_data.py
        ```
        * This will generate `influencers.parquet`, `posts.parquet`, `tracking_data.parquet`, and `payouts.parquet`.

5.  **Run the Streamlit Dashboard:**
    * Execute the Streamlit application:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```
    * The dashboard will open in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## How to Use the Dashboard

* **Filters (Top Section):** Use the dropdown filters (Brand, Platform, Category, Tier, Date Range) to refine your analysis.
* **Performance Overview:** View overall campaign KPIs (Revenue, ROAS, Orders, etc.).
* **Conversion Funnel:** Understand the journey from posts to revenue.
* **Charts:** Explore trends and distributions related to ROAS, revenue, and platform performance.
* **Key Insights:** Read dynamic summaries of campaign highlights.

## Deployment

This dashboard can be deployed on various cloud platforms like **Streamlit Community Cloud**, **Hugging Face Spaces (using Docker SDK)**, or **Render.com**. Ensure your GitHub repository is up-to-date, and then follow the specific deployment instructions for your chosen platform, configuring the build and start commands appropriately (e.g., `streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT`).
